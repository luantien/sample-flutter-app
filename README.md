# Habit Tracker with Gamification App
This is a sample Flutter app to help you fast-track your learning with a focus on Flutter's concepts (From Basic to Advanced) while diving deep into Flutter app development.

## Learning Agenda
### Part 1: Flutter Fundamentals Review
- **Set up the environment**: Ensure your `Flutter` and `Dart SDKs` are updated.
- **Core Widgets & Layouts**: Quick review of commonly used widgets like `Container`, `Column`, `Row`, `Stack`, etc.
- **Navigation & Routing**: Learn about `Navigator 2.0` and how to handle complex routing in Flutter apps.
- **Other Key Topics**: Navigation stacks, Named routes, deep linking.

### Part 2: State Management
- **Bloc Pattern**: Study the `BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern` for managing state in Flutter apps.
- **Provider & Riverpod**: Explore how to handle state using the `provider` and `riverpod` packages.
- **Other Key Topics**: `streams`, `event-based state management`, `dependency injection`.

### Part 3: Advanced UI/Animations
- **Custom UI**: Learn about creating custom widgets, themes, and responsive designs.
- **Animations**: Dive deep into Flutter's animation framework. Study AnimatedBuilder, AnimatedWidget, and implicit animations.
- **Key Topics**: Hero animations, Tween animations, and physics-based animations.
### Part 4: Asynchronous Programming
- **Future & Streams**: Master Dart's async programming with Future, Stream, and async/await.
- **Handling API requests**: Work with http package, error handling, and timeout mechanisms.

### Part 5: Flutter Plugins & Native Integration
- **Flutter Plugins**: Learn how to use and write Flutter plugins to access platform-specific features.
- **Platform Channels**: Dive into platform channels to integrate with native code (Swift/Objective-C for iOS and Java/Kotlin for Android).

### Part 6: Testing and Debugging
- **Unit, Widget, and Integration Testing**: Understand how to write test cases for different layers of Flutter apps.
- **Debugging Tools**: Learn to use DevTools for performance monitoring and debugging.

### Part 7: Performance Optimization
- **Performance Profiling**: Optimize Flutter apps by reducing jank, optimizing build methods, and using const constructors.
- **Lazy Loading & Caching**: Learn efficient scrolling techniques with large data sets using ListView and GridView.

### Final Tips: 
- Build a small but challenging project, incorporating the concepts you've learned throughout the week, to solidify your advanced kowledge.

## Project Overview
### Objectives
- Create a habit-tracking app where users can set daily/weekly goals, track their progress, earn points for consistency, and unlock badges as they complete habits.
- The app should motivate users to build healthy routines through visual feedback and rewards.

### Core Features
1. `User Authentication`: Allow users to create accounts and sync their habits across devices.
2. `Habit Management`: Users can add, update, and delete habits, setting recurring goals.
3. `Progress Tracking`: Track daily/weekly habit completion and visualize progress.
4. `Gamification`: Add point-based rewards, badges, and streaks to encourage users to stay consistent.
5. `Reminders`: Integrate notifications to remind users about their habits.
6. `Performance Optimizations`: Ensure smooth UI with efficient state management and optimizations for animations and data handling.
